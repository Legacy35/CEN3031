# Team Double Name CEN3031 Project

To get the project to start, use ```npm start``` inside of the server/noderouter/ folder. This will start the proxy server that forwards requests to the correct places. **This is required** or the client will not work properly. 

From there, use ```npm start``` inside of the client/ folder to launch the React web client.

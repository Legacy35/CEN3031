# Team Double Name CEN3031 Project

To get the project to start, use ```npm install``` and then ```npm start``` inside of the server/noderouter/ folder. This will start the proxy server that forwards requests to the correct places. **This is required** or the client will not work properly and you won't be able to develop the app. 

From there, use ```npm install``` and then ```npm start``` inside of the client/ folder to launch the React web client. 

After doing this, your development environment is ready to go.

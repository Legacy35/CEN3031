## Technologies Used

### MERN Stack

* MongoDB 
  * Used for more complex data that cannot easily be stored in an SQL table

* ExpressJS
  * Request routing

* ReactJS
  * Used for the web client

* NodeJS
  * Used as a proxy between client and Apache

### LAMP Stack

* Linux
  * Used to host project VPS

* Apache web server
  * Used as an environment to run PHP

* MySQL
  * Used where convenient due to its simplistic integration with PHP

* PHP
  * used for CRUD operations due to its simplicity and lack of boilerplate

### Libraries

* jQuery (JavaScript)
  * Used almost exclusively as a wrapper for vanilla JS AJAX calls.

* Bootstrap 4 (CSS)
  * If you use pure vanilla CSS and no Bootstrap you're insane

### Current considerations

* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/ "Matplotlib Python library") graphing library (Python)

* [DJango](https://www.djangoproject.com/ "DJango Python Library") (Python). Required to use Matplotlib on the back-end.
